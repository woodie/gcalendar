# Gclendar launcher MIDlet

I have the new Nokia 3310 3G. There is a native [Gcal app](http://boostapps.com/apps/gcal/), but it uses OAuth 1.0 which is no longer supported. Fortunately, Gclendar's mweb UI works on the Nokia's OperaMini browser.

I created this Gclendar launcher MIDlet because opening Gclendar from an OperaMini bookmark was annoying.
